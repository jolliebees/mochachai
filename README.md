👋  Hi, I’m @jolliebees

✨ I'm a student and a web developer.

✨ I enjoy learning new things.

✨ In the past years, I learned Phyton, R, and SQL for Relational Database.

✨ And currently, I'm  learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Front-end Development.

🌿 In free time, I loves to hike in the nature with my husband and my dog.
