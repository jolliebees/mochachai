👋  Hi, I’m @jolliebees

🌺 I'm a student and a web developer.

🌺 I enjoy learning new things.

🌺 In the past years, I've learned Phyton, R, and SQL for Relational Database.

🌺 Currently, I'm  learning different type of programming language such as: HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Front-end Development;
   and C++ (part of school degree requirement); and C# , why not 😉.

🌿 In free time, I loves to hike in the nature with my husband and my dog.
