ğŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m @jolliebees

ğŸŒº I'm a student and a web developer.

ğŸŒº I enjoy learning new things.

ğŸŒº In the past years, I've learned Phyton, R, and SQL for Relational Database.

ğŸŒº Currently, I'm  learning different type of programming language such as: HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Front-end Development;
   and C++ (part of school degree requirement); and Java for the Front-end and Back-end Development.
   
ğŸŒº For the fun reason, I use no code/ low code tools too!

ğŸŒ¿ In free time, I loves to hike in the nature with my husband and my dog.
